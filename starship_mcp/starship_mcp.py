You're in the STARPORT phase. This is where you browse available flight configs
and select the next waypoint journey for your mission.

## What Just Happened

You either:
- Just plotted a course (mission started)
- Completed a LANDING phase (session reviewed and documented)

Either way, you're now ready to select your next flight.

## What Happens Next

### Step 1: Browse Available Flights

Call `starship.fly()` to see available flight configs:

```python
starship.fly(path="{starlog_path if starlog_path else '/path/to/project'}")
```

This will show:
- Available flight configs organized by category
- Default flight configs (auto-populated)
- Primitives you created during sessions
- Composite flight configs you built

### Step 2: Select and Start a Flight

Once you find the flight config you want, start it with waypoint:

```python
waypoint.start_waypoint_journey(
    config_path="/path/to/flight/config.json",
    starlog_path="{starlog_path if starlog_path else '/path/to/project'}"
)
```

This will:
- Initialize the waypoint journey
- Load the PayloadDiscovery
- Enter SESSION phase
- Guide you through each step

## Session Phase

Once waypoint journey starts:
- Follow the waypoint steps
- Use knowledge_update() to capture learnings
- Call end_starlog() when done
- This returns you to LANDING phase

## Summary

🔹 You are in STARPORT phase
🔹 NEXT: Call fly() to browse available flights
🔹 THEN: Call waypoint.start_waypoint_journey() to begin session
🔹 WORK: Follow waypoints, capture knowledge
🔹 END: Call end_starlog() to enter LANDING phase

You've ended your session and entered the LANDING phase. This is where you review
what you captured and document your progress before continuing the mission.

## What Just Happened

Your STARLOG session has ended. Any knowledge you captured during the session using
`knowledge_update()` has been stored as primitive flight configs.

## What Happens Next - 3 Mandatory Steps

The LANDING phase has 3 required steps (OMNISANC enforces this sequence):

### Step 1: landing_routine() ✅ (You just called this)

You're here now. This tool explains the LANDING phase.

### Step 2: session_review() (CALL THIS NEXT)

This will show you:
- All primitives you captured during the session
- How many steps each primitive has
- Composition syntax for combining primitives into larger flight configs

Call it like this:
```
starship.session_review(starlog_path="{starlog_path if starlog_path else '/path/to/project'}")
```

### Step 3: giint.respond() (REQUIRED AFTER session_review)

After session_review, you MUST document this session's progress in the mission QA.

session_review will give you the exact mission_id and instructions for calling
giint.respond() with your session notes.

## After All 3 Steps Complete

Once you've completed landing_routine → session_review → giint.respond, you can:

- **Continue mission**: Call `starship.fly()` to browse flights for next session
- **Complete mission**: Call `complete_mission(mission_id)` to finish

## Summary

🔹 You are in LANDING phase
🔹 NEXT: Call session_review() to see your captured primitives
🔹 THEN: Call giint.respond() to document this session
🔹 THEN: fly() for next session OR complete_mission()

# FLIGHT CONFIGURATION TOOLS
# These tools manage the captain's flight configurations and mission planning

# TODO: FUTURE MODE INTEGRATION
# =============================
# When MODE system is fully implemented, enhance fly() to:
# 1. Mode-Based Flight Config Filtering:
#    - PLANNING Mode: Show only planning-oriented flight configs
#      (project_design, architecture_planning, requirement_gathering, etc.)
#    - EXECUTION Mode: Show only execution-oriented flight configs  
#      (debugging_methodology, feature_implementation, testing_workflow, etc.)
#    - FREESTYLE Mode: Show all flight configs (current behavior)
# 2. Mode Integration Flow:
#    - Captain sets mode in STARSHIP (planning/execution/freestyle)
#    - fly() automatically filters available flight configs by mode
#    - Clear separation of "what kind of mission" (mode) vs "specific workflow" (flight config)
# 3. Enhanced UX:
#    - Mode indicator in flight config display
#    - Mode-specific guidance and recommendations
#    - Clear workflow: set_mode() → fly() → select relevant flight config
# 4. GIINT Integration:
#    - Mode determines which GIINT tools are emphasized
#    - Clear guidance on when to use giint.respond() based on mode
#    - Mode-specific capture triggers (planning discoveries vs execution insights)
# Implementation Strategy:
# - Add mode parameter (optional, defaults to current behavior)
# - Integrate with GIINT mode system for automatic mode detection
# - Filter flight configs by mode categories when mode is specified
# - Maintain backward compatibility with current unfiltered behavior
# This will make STARSHIP the true coordination layer between GIINT project management
# and STARLOG mission execution, with MODE as the bridge connecting all systems.

📚 KNOWLEDGE UPDATE HELP

## Purpose
Capture domain-specific knowledge during your session as a primitive flight config.
Each knowledge capture creates a multi-step PayloadDiscovery that can be composed
into larger flight configs later.

## StepInput Schema

Each step requires exactly TWO fields:

```json
{
  "title": "Short descriptive title",
  "content": "Detailed step instructions"
}
```

### Field Requirements:
- **title** (required): Brief step title (e.g., "Set up OAuth credentials")
- **content** (required): Detailed instructions for this step (e.g., "1. Go to Google Cloud Console\\n2. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID...")

### ❌ Common Mistakes:
- Missing title or content field → Validation error
- Using other field names → Validation error
- Empty strings → Not recommended

## Usage Examples

### Single Step:
```python
knowledge_update(
    title="Google OAuth Setup Guide",
    steps=[
        {
            "title": "Create OAuth credentials",
            "content": "1. Go to Google Cloud Console\\n2. Navigate to APIs & Services\\n3. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
        }
    ],
    subdomain="authentication",
    process="oauth/google",
    starlog_path="/path/to/project"
)
```

### Multiple Steps:
```python
knowledge_update(
    title="Complete Authentication Flow",
    steps=[
        {
            "title": "Install dependencies",
            "content": "Run: npm install passport passport-google-oauth20"
        },
        {
            "title": "Configure OAuth credentials",
            "content": "1. Create .env file\\n2. Add GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"
        },
        {
            "title": "Implement callback route",
            "content": "Create /auth/google/callback endpoint to handle OAuth response"
        }
    ],
    subdomain="authentication",
    process="oauth/google",
    starlog_path="/path/to/project"
)
```

## What Happens After Calling

1. ✅ Creates PayloadDiscovery with your steps
2. ✅ Each step becomes a PayloadDiscoveryPiece
3. ✅ Stores PD in starport_pd_registry
4. ✅ Creates primitive flight config pointing to PD file
5. ✅ Links to current session in starport_session_knowledge
6. ✅ Available for composition in session_review()

## During Session Review

When you call `session_review()` after ending your session, you'll see all
captured primitives with step counts. You can then compose them into larger
flight configs using `add_flight_config()`.

## Required Context

- Must have active STARLOG session (call `starlog.start_starlog()` first)
- Must have active course (call `starship.plot_course()` first)
- Domain comes from course_state, you provide subdomain/process

## Parameters

- **title**: Overall title for this knowledge capture
- **steps**: List of step objects (each with title and content)
- **subdomain**: Specific subdomain (e.g., "authentication", "api", "database")
- **process**: Specific process (e.g., "oauth/google", "rest/crud", "postgres/setup")
- **starlog_path**: Path to your STARLOG project

## Tips

- Keep each step focused on ONE specific task
- Use clear, actionable titles
- Include enough detail in content so future-you understands
- Group related steps into a single knowledge_update call
- Multiple captures per session is fine - they'll all show in session_review()
